Code Description: Our final project is a text-based adventure game that incorporates connected rooms and mini challenges that contriubte to a final "boss" challenge that will ultimately decide whether or not you win the game. The first mini challenge is a game of hangman where the user has to guess the name of the Sun God that introduced them in the beginning in order to move forward. The second mini challenge is a riddle game where the user gets the chance to answer a maximum of 3 riddles, and pass on to the next level if they get at least 2 out of the three riddles correct. The third challenge is an alternate rock, paper, scissors game called Stone, Cloth, Blade where the player can only play one round against Mama Quilla, the moon goddess character. The fourth challenge is a dance game where the player uses arrow keys to follow the dancer on the screen. The fifth challenge is based on a single question which determines how the player will do in the subsequent fight with a mummy that is guarding the treasure.
The game is set in Peru where the player is able to explore the land, and enter the temple of Inti, the ancient Sun god that the Incas worshipped. There are four main characters in the game excluding the player : Inti, Pachamama (Mother Earth), Mama Quilla (Moon Goddess), and the Mummy. Our intention with this game was to introduce the player to Inca mythology and the roots of Peruvian culture in a indirect and entertaining way.
